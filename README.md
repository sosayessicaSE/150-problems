This repo is my personal challenge: solve 150 LeetCode problems. No copy-pasting, no shortcuts: just me, the code, and some coffee.


## What to Expect

- Solutions are my own, written from scratch.
- Problems are split by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and later Hard.
- Code is kept clean, readable, and sometimes with comments explaining parts.

## Why I’m Doing This

- To get better at algorithms and data structures.
- To push myself to stay consistent.
- To have a reference of everything I’ve solved, because remembering 150 solutions is impossible otherwise.

## How I’m Organizing
/Easy
/Medium
/Hard

Each file is named after the problem, so it’s easy to find and follow along.

## Notes
I might refactor or improve solutions over time, this is a living repo.
If you’re also practicing, feel free to check out the solutions, but I encourage you to try the problem before looking.
